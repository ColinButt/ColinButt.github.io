							</header>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Amor.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								Amor Fati is a 2D puzzle platformer where the main gimmick is that the Player reading through a storybook depicting the events that he will accomplish backwards. 
								For example, the goal of the first scene of the final level of chapter one involves firing a large boulder at a dragon. From there the player must work backwards, transporting the boulder, covering it with spikes, setting it on a fire and even turning a small pebble into a boulder.

							</p>
									<h3>Goals and outcomes</h3>
								<p>
								Amor Fati was my final, major project I undertook at Qantm College. 
								While I had worked in smaller teams on smaller projects before, this was my first experience working with artists and designers to conceptualise all aspects of a game project and bring it to life.

								</p>
									<h3>My roles</h3>
								<p>
									I joined this group as the Lead Programmer, and while I had help from the other members, I did most of the coding myself. 
									I also worked with our designers to conceptualise mechanics, levels and puzzles, and discussed concepts and ideas with them.
									Playmaker was considered, and while I enjoyed trying it out, I ended up finding it was easiest to just code in C#.

							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/combat3.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								This project was developed as a solo project during the last 16 years of my Design Degree.
								The concept was of a simple isometic RPG Combat system where players control four seperate classes, each with their own special abilities.
							</p>
									<h3>Classes</h3>
								<p>
									There are four classes in the game, and each has their own specific roles and abilities.
									<ul>
										<li>The Cold Knight uses her magic to block projectiles, debilitatw enemies and heal herself or allies.  </li>
										<li>The Life Thief uses her black magic to drain health, destroy spells and mark targets to make them more vulnerable to attacks. </li>
										<li>The Goblin Archer supports his party by firing debilitative arrows that drain health, energy and armor and inspire allies. </li>
										<li>The Dwarven Priest calls upon his ancestors to restore health, energy and taunt enemies. </li>
									</ul>
									you can read more details about the classes in <a href="Independent Character Design Document.pdf"> this document. </a>
								</p>
									<h3>My roles</h3>
								<p>
									While the models and textures used were downloaded from websites, all terrain and particle effects were created by myself using Unity's Particle and Terrain Systems.
								</p>

								A serious game designed to teach children how to perform scientific experiments in a safe, virtual environment.
								In this game, players will light bunsen burners, change the colour of fire, create towers of flame and more!

							<p>
								Hivemind is a 2D shooter where you play as an Alien attempting to assimilate and consume human soldiers and turn them into mindless slaves.
							</p>
									<h3>The Game</h3>
								<p>
								While the focus of the game was learning C++ programming, the design goal of this game was Chaos.
								While balance passes were made to make the game 'fun', the game's concept and goal was to make a game as chaotic as possible, within reason.
								While there is a manual mode, players have the option to automatic fire bullets that allow them to take control of an enemy on impact.
								The chaos comes from the fact that once controlled, the new slaves will also fire when the player does, and will turn back into enemies upon being hit.
								Furthermore, the main alien dying results in an instant game over.
								
								In Swarm mode, the player's goal is to assimilate as many humans as possible. After defeating 10 soldiers, a boss encounter begins where the player must fend against a small, teleporting enemy.
								In Titan Mode, the player's goal is to control then consume as many enemies as possible. Controlling 5 enemies causes the player to destroy them and 'grow', 
								increasing its size which in turn increases speed and makes it increasingly difficult to avoid bullets and move around the arena without bouncing off another target!

								</p>
									<h3>Goals and outcomes</h3>
								<p>
									Hivemind was my first game made entirely in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio. The process first began with the building of a Maths library which included classes for Vectors and Matrix 2,3 and 4, 
									which include basic functions such as addition, multiplications and more specific such as Translation, Rotation or scale 
									then using the library and a provided AIE library to build a 2D game of my choice which included these elements.
									The process also involved learning about programming concepts such as collision or heirarchies, which I had previously known about but never created.

							<p>
							Kingmaker is a 2D tactical strategy where the player controls an army of animals fighting to help the lion cub gain domination.
							</p>
									<h3>The Game</h3>
								<p>
								There are multiple units in the game, each with statistics that affect them and an ability that defines them:
								</p>
								<ul> 
								<li>The Cub represents the king, and it will cause the player to win the game if it lands on the opposing side's back row. It can also resurrect dead allies. </li>
								<li> The deadly Lioness protects her cub by dashing throwing herself into the enemy frontline. </li>
								<li>The turtle protects its allies by summoning green shells.</li>
								<li>Elephants heals weakened allies by spraying water over them.</li>
								<li> Giraffes can hit enemies from a distance by bashing their heads on them.</li>
								<li>Owls reduce enemy energy and health by kamikazing into them.</li>
								<li>Hippos bash their targets with enough force to push them back.</li>
								<li>Monkeys throw tiny pebbles which stagger enemies, reducing their energy.</li>
								<li>Zebras are basic soldiers with no special properties save numbers. </li>
								
								<ul>
								</p>
									<h3>Goals and outcomes</h3>
								<p>
								The primary goal of Kingmaker was to learn a simple, open source C++ games library. The secondary goal of the project was A.I. creation.
								<br />
								While the A.I isn't as competitive as it could be, it has been designed to be as unique as possible. 
								Every enemy unit uses factors such as range, availability of pathing, and status of other units to determine their next move.
