								<h2 id="AF">Amor Fati</h2>
							</header>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Amor.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								Amor Fati is a 2D puzzle platformer where the main gimmick is that the Player reading through a storybook depicting the events that he will accomplish backwards. 
								For example, the goal of the first scene of the final level of chapter one involves firing a large boulder at a dragon. From there the player must work backwards, setting the boulder on fire, covering it in spikes, soaking it in oil, and pushing a pebble down a hill to grow it into a boulder.

							</p>
									<h3>Goals and outcomes</h3>
								<p>
								Amor Fati was my final, major project I undertook at Qantm College. 
								While I had worked in teams on smaller projects before, this was my first experience working with artists and designers to conceptualise all aspects of a game project and bring it to life.
								As such, challenges in the project came from things like testing and debugging, implementing and animating sprites, and the general process of development and design.
								</p>
									<h3>My roles</h3>
								<p>
									I joined this group as the Lead Programmer, and while I had help from the other members, I did most of the coding myself. 
									I also worked with our designers to conceptualise mechanics, levels and puzzles, and discussed concepts and ideas with them.
									Most of the challenges involved in the project involved asking designers what they wanted from a scene, planning out the mechanics it would use, then implement them, and finally asking them for feedback on how it works or needs improvement.

								<h2 id="CG">Complex Combat Scripting. </h2>
							</header>
							<!-- <a class="image featured"><img src="images/Hivem.png" alt="" /></a> -->
							<p>
							I developed this project as a game exploring multiple complex game development aspects using AIE's bootstrap.
							The project makes heavy use of fmod for dynamic music playing, and IMGUI for its interface, but it's main goal is its automated combat cycle, which is developed and tweaked by players through the use .lua scripts.
							</p>
									<h3>The Game</h3>
								<p> In this game, players begin play by scripting out orders for their dark knight, telling it where and when to use its abilities to generate resources and attack its foes, then generating their script and watching the Knight fight with no further input until the battle ends.
The four enemy types are scripted in the same manner, and work cooperatively to fight the warrior.</p>
									<h3> Other complex ideas </h3>
									<p> A major goal of the project was creating a dynamic, featured, turn based RPG system, so it also includes elements like speed calculation, progression, particles and music, implemented through fmod, which changes dynamically as the player gets closer to victory or defeat. </p>								
									<p> All art and music used in this project was downloaded from opengameart. </p>

							<p>
							Idle Gods is the first game I developed solely for mobile, and I designed it as an idle game where eventual death is possible, and the game's goal is survival.						
							</p>
									<h3>The Game Loop.</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>On the first screen, players can build and assign workers to various buildings and jobs.</li>
									<li>On the second screen, players can view their workers and assign professions.</li>
									<li>On the third screen, players spend their blessings, earned from gods by playing the game, to cast spells and upgrade the city.</li>
									<li>On the final screen, players can buy and trade resources, including civilians.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>When the timer hits 0, the game will increment progress, adding/subtracting resources and earning the blessings from deities depending on the player's actions. If resources go over their cap, or the civilians go hungry, discontent with rise and a civilian will eventually quit. </p>
									<p>Another feature is the night/winter mechanic, where progress halts and the people spend less resources. This balances the player's need to check the game during the day by giving them a rest period where they are in no danger of damaging their civilisation.</p>

									<h3> Future Development. </h3>
									<p> The end goal of this project of this game would be something similar to a roguelike, where the difficulty curves and can be prepared for, death is expected, and the lifetime of the village would be a lot smaller than a normal idle game. </p>

								<h2 id="AI">Artificial Intelligence and Map Tool.</h2>
							</header>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Hivem.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								This project was developed in C++ as I learnt how to implement A* Pathfinding.
								<br />The playerâ€™s stated goal is to prevent either of the two AI controlled factions from defeating the other.
							</p>
									<h3>The Project</h3>
								<p> 
									The project involves AI armies that quickly grow in size and strength, and then form squads to attack enemy buildings.
									At start of play, each of the four elementals begins by patrolling between their home and mine, collecting resources which slowly create new units.
									As a unit collects resources, it slowly increases in strength, and upon reaching a high enough point, stations itself near the home and begins recruiting other units to help it move to and attack the enemy.
									Once a squad is formed, the group travels to the center Tower, which must be captured before they can continue to the enemy bases.								
									
								</p>
									<h3> Mapping Tool </h3>
									<p> 
									Perhaps the greatest achievement is its implementation of a Map Editor I made for a completely unrelated project in C#, using winforms.
									The Map editor is designed to function similarly to RPGMaker's one, with users selecting tile types from a menu and laying them down onto squares.
									Each tile the user places down also has an index layer, which is exported along with the Image, and is then fed into the A* pathfinding's node map.
									The end result is a automated movement on a map that does not need to be inputted manually.

							<p>
								This project was developed as a solo project during the last 16 weeks of my Design Degree.
								The concept was of a simple isometic RPG Combat system where players control four seperate classes, each with their own special abilities.
							</p>
									<h3>Classes</h3>
								<p>
									There are four classes in the game, and each has their own specific roles and abilities.
									<ul>
										<li>The Cold Knight uses her magic to block projectiles, debilitatw enemies and heal herself or allies.  </li>
										<li>The Life Thief uses her black magic to drain health, destroy spells and mark targets to make them more vulnerable to attacks. </li>
										<li>The Goblin Archer supports his party by firing debilitative arrows that drain health, energy and armor and inspire allies. </li>
										<li>The Dwarven Priest calls upon his ancestors to restore health, energy and taunt enemies. </li>
									</ul>
									you can read more details about the classes in <a href="Independent Character Design Document.pdf"> this document. </a>
								</p>
									<h3>My roles</h3>
								<p>
									While the models and textures used were downloaded from websites, all terrain and particle effects were created by myself using Unity's Particle and Terrain Systems.

								<h2 id="HM">Hivemind, my first game developed outside Unity</h2>
							</header>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Hive1.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								Hivemind is a 2D shooter where you play as an Alien attempting to assimilate and consume human soldiers and turn them into mindless slaves.
							</p>
									<h3>The Game</h3>
								<p>
								While the focus of the game was learning C++ programming, the design goal of this game was Chaos.
								While balance passes were made to make the game 'fun', the game's concept and goal was to make a game as chaotic as possible, within reason.
								While there is a manual mode, players have the option to automatic fire bullets that allow them to take control of an enemy on impact.
								The chaos comes from the fact that once controlled, the new slaves will also fire when the player does, and will turn back into enemies upon being hit.
								Furthermore, the main alien dying results in an instant game over.
								
								In Swarm mode, the player's goal is to assimilate as many humans as possible.
								In Titan Mode, the player's goal is to control then consume as many enemies as possible. Controlling 5 enemies causes the player to destroy them and 'grow', 
								increasing its size which in turn increases speed and makes it increasingly difficult to avoid bullets and move around the arena without bouncing off another target!

								</p>
									<h3>Goals and outcomes</h3>
								<p>
									Hivemind was my first game made entirely in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio. The process first began with the building of a Maths library which included classes for Vectors and Matrix 2,3 and 4, 
									which include basic functions such as addition, multiplications and more specific such as Translation, Rotation or scale 
									then using the library and a provided AIE library to build a 2D game of my choice which included these elements.
									The process also involved learning about programming concepts such as collision or heirarchies, which I had previously known about but never created.

							<p>
							Kingmaker is a 2D tactical strategy where the player controls an army of animals fighting to help the lion cub gain domination.
							</p>
									<h3>The Game</h3>
								<p>
								There are multiple units in the game, each with statistics that affect them and an ability that defines them:
								</p>
								<ul> 
								<li>The Cub represents the king, and it will cause the player to win the game if it lands on the opposing side's back row. It can also resurrect dead allies. </li>
								<li> The deadly Lioness protects her cub by dashing throwing herself into the enemy frontline. </li>
								<li>The turtle protects its allies by summoning green shells.</li>
								<li>Elephants heals weakened allies by spraying water over them.</li>
								<li> Giraffes can hit enemies from a distance by bashing their heads on them.</li>
								<li>Owls reduce enemy energy and health by kamikazing into them.</li>
								<li>Hippos bash their targets with enough force to push them back.</li>
								<li>Monkeys throw tiny pebbles which stagger enemies, reducing their energy.</li>
								<li>Zebras are basic soldiers with no special properties save numbers. </li>
								
								<ul>
								</p>
									<h3>Goals and outcomes</h3>
								<p>
								The primary goal of Kingmaker was to learn a simple, open source C++ games library. The secondary goal of the project was A.I. creation.
								<br />
								While the A.I isn't as competitive as it could be, it has been designed to be as unique as possible. 
								Every enemy unit uses factors such as range, availability of pathing, and status of other units to determine their next move.
