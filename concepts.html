										<h3>
											Even a whisper will kill you.
										</h3>
									<a href="images/ES05.png" class="image featured"><img src="images/ES1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Eternal Silence is a 2D platformer built off a single concept: Any sound, however small, is magical. Sound tore the world apart, and only complete and utter silence can stop itself from reaching its end. But is survival worth the price of never speaking again? Only the whispers will ever know...
									</p>
										<header>
											<h3>Whispers</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The Whispers are the three legendary couriers of sound who are said to have been active since the end of the world.
											</p></p>
											The Blade uses her toners' knife to as both a devasating means of ambushing opponents and teleporting to areas that would otherwise be out of reach.
											</p><p>
											The Shaper uses his once powerful summoning magic to conjure and banish obstacles from existance, and uses his phoenix familiar to search the path forward.
											</P>
											<p>
											The hunter uses their terror-inducing ability to shapeshift into a were-leopard to aid both in traversal of the city and the devastation of those who stand before them.
											</P>

										<h2 id="BE">Benefactor</h2>
										<h3>
										Even free energy has a price.
										</h3>
									<p>
									Free energy was obtained. Not through gadgetry, but through the human mind itself. 
									By harnessing and channeling this raw power, humanity unlocked complete control over electricity, but not over themselves.
									For this power manifested itself in the form of Benefactors, spirits of pure energy that seek to protect and guide their masters.
									But while most are happy with the arrangement, 
									<br />
									there are those struggle simply to maintain control of their own minds...
									</p>
									<h3>The Incident</h3>
									<p>
									Your player character was just another college student until they came for him. Figures blazing with pure light and power that let no obstacle stop them.
									Your last memory was one of pure agony, and when you awoke, your benefactor is gone.
									</p>
									<h3>The Agency</h3>
										<p>
										The Agency was founded by a former Enforcer who grew tired of watching her colleagues mistreat citizens they sought to protect.
										Where once the mere concept of forming a team of troubled agents was deemed laughable, now the team is one of the most effective and compassionate groups around.
										</p>
									<h3>Gameplay</h3>
									<p>
										The primary mechanic  of Benefactor is the use of the titular entities. While set to a character, its energy is used to amplify the agent's abilities and attributes until their power runs out and they are unleashed.
										While each character has their own class and Benefactor which complement their abilities, they do not necessarily need to always use the same Benefactor. After being unleashed, the Benefactor can return to a different agent, changing the way their abilities work and their role.
										For example, Leanne's electrical Benefactor normally amplifies her abilities to move and attack quickly, but when infused with Cain's Blood Benefactor, she gains the ability to drain health from enemies and restore it to allies.

										<h2 id="AL">Philosopher's Family</h2>
										<h3>
											Acclinis falsis animus meliora recusat—The mind attracted by what is false has no relish for better things
										</h3>									
										<h3>The Stone</h3>
										<p>
										The family of philosophers long used their powers over alchemy to protect their people and home. Where other countries had to rely on powerful, but harmful scientific invention, the people of the fields were always protected by their alchemists.
										Until they decided they need more. The Philosopher's stone has always existed in alchemical theory as the final, but most dangerous, pursuit of the craft, but none attempted it until a young woman deemed it necessary to perform the ritual.
										And while the stone was created, the darkness unleashed by its creation was evenetually the end of her.
										</p>
											<h3>Grief</h3>
										<p>
										Five years have passed since Adahn's mother lost her life in her bloody rampage through the grounds of the Academy, and while his skill as a swordsman and alchemist are unparalled, the prognosis is not good: He will die, much like his mother within the siz months, and the only thing left doing in his life is reconciling with the people who banished him from his home: His Family.
										<br /> 
										Philosopher's Family is a story about death, grief and the lies we tell ourselves. But it's also about hope, family and forgiving both ourselves and one another, and while the people of the fields still need him, Adahn's final goal is to help his family come to terms with their loss.
										</p>
										<h3>Gameplay </h3>
										<p>
										The primary focus of Philosopher's Family is time management, as the player must strive to make the most of Adahn's life as he travels through the country, interacting with his family and helping villagers with their problems while combating manifestations of darkness and grief, both real and imaginary, that attempt to bar his path.
