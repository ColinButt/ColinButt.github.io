									<p>
										Eternal Silence is a 2D platformer built off a single concept: Any sound, however small, is magical. Sound tore the world apart, and only complete and utter silence can stop itself from reaching its end. But is survival worth the price of never speaking again? Only the whispers will ever know...

											<h3>Whispers</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The Whispers are the three legendary couriers of sound who are said to have been active since the end of the world.
											</p></p>
											The Blade uses her toners' knife to as both a devasating means of ambushing opponents and teleporting to areas that would otherwise be out of reach.
											</p><p>
											The Shaper uses his once powerful summoning magic to conjure and banish obstacles from existance, and uses his phoenix familiar to search the path forward.
											</P>
											<p>
											The hunter uses their terror-inducing ability to shapeshift into a were-leopard to aid both in traversal of the city and the devastation of those who stand before them.
											</P>

										<h2 id="PS">Philosopher's Blood</h2>
										<h3>
											"Acclinis falsis animus meliora recusat." 
											â€”The mind attracted by what is false has no relish for better things.
										</h3>									
										<h3>The Stone</h3>
										<p>
										The family of philosophers long used their powers over alchemy to protect their people and home. Where other countries had to rely on powerful, but harmful scientific invention, the people of the fields were always protected by their alchemists.
										Until they decided they need more. The Philosopher's stone has always existed in alchemical theory as the final, but most dangerous, pursuit of the craft, but none attempted it until a young woman deemed it necessary to perform the ritual.
										And while the stone was created, the darkness unleashed by its creation was evenetually the end of her.
										</p>
											<h3>Grief</h3>
										<p>
										Five years have passed since Adahn's mother lost her life in her bloody rampage through the grounds of the Academy, and while his skill as a swordsman and alchemist are unparalled, the prognosis is not good: He will die, much like his mother within the six months, and the only thing left doing in his life is reconciling with the people who banished him from his home: His Family.
										<br /> 
										Philosopher's Blood is a story about death, grief and the little, white lies we tell ourselves and others until we begin to believe them. But it's also about hope, family and forgiving both ourselves and one another, and while the people of the fields still need him, Adahn's final goal is to help his family come to terms with their loss.
										</p>
										<h3>Gameplay </h3>
										<p>
										The primary focus of Philosopher's Blood is time management, as the player must strive to make the most of Adahn's life as he travels through the country, interacting with his family and helping villagers with their problems while combating manifestations of darkness and grief, both real and imaginary, that attempt to bar his path.

										<h2 id="SS">Fires in the Sky</h2>
										<h3>
										All the lights in the sky are stars!
										</h3>									
										<h3>Pitch:</h3>
										<p>
										Fires in the sky is a single player Gacha/roguelike hybrid, which blends mechanics of luck-based gacha, roguelike permadeath and progression
<br />										
										Like FTL, you jump between star systems and fight enemies at each planet. At the end of the system, you can use the star to randomly Summon a new creature as an ally. You unlock creatures for summoning by defeating them, but you're limited to only three summons per play-through, so you have to make do with the team you get. When you die, one of your creatures is removed from the pool, but the rest is kept between runs, allowing for stronger potential parties.
										<br />
										I pitched this idea as a project, and you can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBZvDOXNUaM">here!</a>
										</p>
											<h3>Narrative</h3>
										<p>
										There is no life left in the universe. Earth is the last home of life. The Hatred has torn through the universe, causing the residents of each world to tear each other apart as the bloodlust takes over. Some have fled. Others have surrendered. Even the omniscient creator was corrupted, its physical avatar but a puppet for the hatred. Earth is next, and an army of corrupted creatures of myth, legend and history stand against you. Can you push back, or will you allow the last fire in the sky to flicker out?
										</p>
										<h3>Main Mechanic </h3>
										<p>
										Players summon new heroes by reaching a star at the center of its system.
										The hero is summoned at random from a pool of heroes, and heroes are unlocked by defeating their enemy versions.
										<br />
										Each hero has three skills. Two are used based off targeting. Typically by tapping on the unit, then again on either an ally, an enemy, or themselves. 
										These abilities are shared across the heroes, with extra traits(Drain,Taunt,Heal,Area,etc) differentiating them. 
										The third ability is an ultimate, which is an ability unique to that hero.
										<br/>When the player is defeated, a random hero in your party in released from the pool.
