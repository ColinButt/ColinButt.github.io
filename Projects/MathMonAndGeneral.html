										<h2>My Game Dev Programming!</h2>
									</header>
										<p>
										While I started game development with RPGmaker, my first exposure to actual programming started in the Unity engine during a design course, where I was taught the basics, then researched the rest myself as I wanted to make my game faster and more complex than the class's scope allowed for. From there, I continued to volenteer to do programming work on any project I had, eventually culimanting in my final project, where I decided to a team as their only Programmer to create Amor Fati. During this time I realised that, while I can design and write, my programming ability is my greatest asset in a team environment. 
										<br />
										This led me to joining AIE's course, which taught me the fundamental I'd skipped, like C++, polymorphism, vector/matrix mathematics, and gave me the knowledge and skills to expand on what I already knew I wanted to do.
										<p>								
										My greatest joy has always been the development and implementation of game ideas and mechanics, but more recently I've discovered the satisfaction that comes from creating systems that facilitate the creation of game content.
										This was first found in my .lua system, which, along with the stated goal of player scripting, allowed me to create enemies and encounters with ease. 										
										</P>
										<header>
										<h3>Mathtastic Monsters</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
										But where this knowledge truly came into play was when I joined a team of Designers and started my Major project, Mathtastic Monsters. In this project, the main mechanic inolved questions, which while procedural, use very specific variances to determine their range of answers. After thinking for a while, we eventually ended up with the button as shown in the following image.
										</p>
										<img src="button.png">
										<p>
											Any button a player clicks on with this script will start a new level with the monster's stats, number range, answer range, and reward changing depending on variables sst.
										</p>
										<p>
											At the end of each turn, a new question is generated using the following function.

											The end result is a system that makes it incredibly easy for Designers to implement, test, and adjust their own questions, all in the editor without needing to change any code.
