										<h2>My Game Dev Skills!</h2>
										<p>
										I've had a long and varied history of education and learning, so to summarise, here's just my history in Game Development!
										</p>
									</header>

											<h3 id="DES">Games Design</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Ever since I was a child, I always had interest in understanding, creating and adapting rules to games and other ideas.
											I also loved playing games as a kid, as well as reading and listening to discussions about design philosophy, balance
											So, really, it shouldn't have come as that much of s surprise when I realised my dream in life was to become a Games Designer.
										</p>
										<header>
											<h3 id ="PRO">Games Programming</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I discovered I loved programming about halfway through my design course when I took my Introduction to Programming class.
											Perhaps it was my past experience with HTML that helped, or my inherent desire to just make a fun game, but regardless I took to it like a fish to water! I spent the rest of that classing devouring
											and speeding through tutorials, both in class and out of class, to the point where I managed to mostly teach myself how to program, albeit
											only in the Unity engine. From there I continued through the course, volenteering for and doing about the programming work I had in any project.
											This culminated in my major project, where I decided to a team as their only Programmer to create Amor Fati.
										</p>
										<p>
											Now I'm studying for an Advanced Diploma in Games Programming at the AIE, and am finally learning many theoretical concepts such as object oriented programming and matrix Mathematics.
