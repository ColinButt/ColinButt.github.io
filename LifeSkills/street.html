							The “Super Awesome Lesson”/”Street Game was our final project, and was developed in an attempt to develop a hub world that players could use to engage with lesson content in a more organic way that linear progression through a series of disparate activities. <br />
							Through this game, players can begin activities like drawing, writing and even playing other games simply by running over to a marked area where the activity takes part. When the activity ends, the player is taken back to the street.</p>
							<p>
							This lesson’s quiz content has also been revamped, and is done through non-linear, branching conversations that require players to think about how their social skills can be applied practically instead of just answering questions. <br />
							Each of the non-playable characters has a problem they’re thinking about, and it’s up to the player to engage with their peers and help them find their way. <br />
							During these moments, the player character’s dialogue will be influenced by choices the player makes.These choices can be conditional, requiring the player to reference previous conversations, or present items acquired while playing other mini-games. When the wrong choice is made, the conversation can either end, restart from an earlier point, or even enter a separate branch.
							<p>
							Of particular note is the Galaxy conversation. This conversation opens when the game begins, with the player character upsetting her and causing her to walk off. Helping fix the player character’s mistake gives the player a goal. To complete Galaxy’s conversation, the player must have already helped Earth, which in-turn requires them to watch the animation when they speak to Air.</p>
