									In this game, the player is again presented with a player character attempting to work through a problem, but this time they require more direct assistance. This game uses a rounds system, where multiple thoughts slowly drift through the game world, and the player must drag them to the center well. Only one answer per round is correct, and the incorrect answers can be reused. <br />
									To keep the experience interesting, this game uses mechanics like floating bubbles and the bouncing well/light bulb in the center to add a sense of feedback.<br />
									Additionally, when the game ends, the player is presented with a small slideshow wherein the character begins to attempt, and eventually succeeds in completing their task.

										<h3>
											Tap on the bubbles to help them grow!
										</h3>
									<a href="Images/mind1.png" class="image featured"><img src="Images/mind1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>									
									Clear minds is the first game I developed for LSGO.<br />
									In this game, the player character is working through a problem, and needs the player to help them focus on thoughts that will help them accomplish their task. Thought bubbles appear around the character and fade away over time. Tapping on a bubble causes it to solidify, and when a “good thought” hits 100% opacity, it locks in. If a bad bubble is tapped, it pops, causing more thoughts appear.
									<br />
									Clear minds is the game that is often assigned to a lesson when no other game will match. This is because of it's primary advantage: It's incredibly easy to make as it requires absolutely no art-support.
									The character assets and backgrounds are taken from animations, and can be copied, leaving the text as the only thing that is unique to each game.

											<h3>Trivia</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
										The game's in-house name "Clear Minds" comes from it's inital concept: In it, players had to tap on bad bubbles to remove them, while leaving the good bubbles on-screen.
										While this made for a much faster experience, it had the problem of causing the player to focus on bad thoughts instead of the positive ones they should be learning about, so the idea was scrapped, but the name lived on...

											<h4>Opening</h4>
											<p>
												The narrative goal of clear minds games is to help characters concentrate on a task, like feeling grateful or being creative.

											<h4>Win state</h4>
											<p>
												The player wins when they have enough bubbles fully grown. This number varies on age group.

											<h4>Loss</h4>
											<p>
											If too many bubbles are on screen, the character panics and resets the game, preventing a standard gameover, but requiring a restart.

											<h4>Global Variables</h4>
											<p>
												Many variables are used to determine the game's rules. These are storied in a JSON file, and can be edited even when the game is on the platform!
